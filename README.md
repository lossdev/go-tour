# go-tour

## Purpose

To provide a main repository of example code, comments, and guides to aid any 
newcomers to the Go language on their way to making exceptional programs. 

## Table of Contents / Covered Material

I'll touch on each of these subjects in order. Later subjects can / will be using 
at least some of the previously covered topics, so going in order from the beginning
(or starting where you're unfamiliar) is recommended. The list of subjects is as
follows:

* [basic syntax](syntax/)
* [data types, variable assignments, and scoping](types-assignments-scoping/)
* [decision making and loops](decisions-loops/)
* [functions, type casting, and error handling](functions-casting-errors/)
* [slices, arrays, and strings](slices-arrays-strings/)
* [data structures and encoding](structures-encoding/)
* maps, channels and goroutines
* gomodules
* object oriented programming, interfaces, and type assertions
* testing and documentation
